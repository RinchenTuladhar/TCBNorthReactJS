        The Tibetan Community UK North Association (TCB) was established in February 2014 in Manchester in the North of England.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our primary objective is to create a common platform where Tibetans and their families are able to generate a thriving community in the North of England.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our main aim is to give Tibetan people residing in the North (including Yorkshire, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Merseyside, Newcastle, and Sunderland) the opportunity to meet other Tibetans and their families with the focus on preserving the language of Tibet, its culture and identity. We aim to keep this alive in our Tibetan Community UK North Association and thriving in the UK for the benefit of the People from Tibet, the Tibetan Cause and more importantly to make others aware of the beauty of our colourful and varied culture.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        We like to come together in various locations throughout the North of England, mainly Manchester and Liverpool, whether it be to celebrate key events in the Tibetan lunar calendar, to raise money through sponsorship or a simple picnic where friends can meet and have fun.
        </p>

        <p>
        The Tibetan Community UK North Association is a very active and inclusive group and welcomes Tibetans as well as people from other traditions and culture.
        </p>

        <p>
        All are welcome!
